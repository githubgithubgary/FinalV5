            // each with cascading delete behavior. SQL Server restricts such configurations to prevent 
            // accidental recursive deletions. Here, by setting DeleteBehavior.Restrict, deleting an Item
            // (Weapon or Armor) will simply nullify the WeaponId or ArmorId in Equipment rather than 
            // cascading a delete through multiple paths.
